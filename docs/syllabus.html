<p>Probability and Statistics is fundamental in many scientific
disciplines. In this course, you will learn the concepts in probability,
discrete and continuous random variables, expectation, variance, moment
generating functions, known probability distributions, sampling, and
estimation. This is a calculus-based probability and statistics course
where we find analytical solutions to probabilistic and statistical
problems, as well as simulation-based reasoning using R. Students who
complete this course will have a calculus-based knowledge of probability
theory and statistics and be able to confidently apply these ideas to
data.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-outcomes" class="section level3">
<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
<p>By the end of the semester, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the theoretical underpinnings of probability, including
conditional probability, independence, and random variables.</li>
<li>Master the theoretical underpinnings of probability distributions
including expectation, variance, and moment generating functions.</li>
<li>Apply probability theory to model random processes.</li>
<li>Apply statistical methods to make inferences about population
parameters, including point estimation, interval estimation, and
hypothesis testing.</li>
<li>Write clear and concise mathematical solutions to probabilistic and
statistical problems.</li>
<li>Communicate effectively about probability and statistics with other
students, instructors, and professionals.</li>
<li>Work independently and as part of a team to solve probabilistic and
statistical problems.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="learning-objectives" class="section level3">
<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>Upon completion of the course, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define conditional probabilities, independence, and Bayesâ
Theorem.</li>
<li>Define random variables and probability functions.</li>
<li>Calculate probabilities using known probability distributions such
as the Bernoulli, Binomial, Geometric, Uniform, Normal, and Exponential
Distributions.</li>
<li>Calculate expected values and variances of random variables, which
measure the central tendency and spread of a distribution.</li>
<li>Use moment generating functions to calculate the moments of a
probability distribution and to analyze its properties.</li>
<li>Compute joint probability distributions for multiple random
variables and calculate marginal distributions from joint
distributions.</li>
<li>Estimate parameters of probability distributions using the maximum
likelihood method, which finds the parameter values that maximize the
likelihood of observing the given data.</li>

consecutive sessions.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-learning-commons" class="section level3">
<h3>The Learning Commons</h3>
<p>Students can get academic assistance through Learning Commons
tutoring services and workshops. The Co-Pilot peer tutoring program
provides students with opportunities to work with other students to get
help in writing, math, group projects, and other courses. Schedule an
appointment to meet with a Co-Pilot (tutor) by visiting the <a
href="www.up.edu/learningcommons" target="_blank">Learning Commons</a>
website. Students can also meet with a Co-Pilot during drop-in hours.
Check the Learning Commons website or drop by the Learning Commons in BC
163 to learn more about their services. Find a tutor at the Learning
Commons to get support on your academic journey.</p>
</div>
<div id="math-resource-center" class="section level3">
<h3>Math Resource Center</h3>
<p>Appointment-based tutoring accepts appointments starting week 1 and
sessions start week 2. Visit the <a
href="https://www.up.edu/learningcommons/tutoring-services/math-resource-center/index.html"
target="_blank">Math Resource Center</a> website to sign-up for an
appointment. Drop-in tutoring is Monday to Thursday, 3:00 PM - 7:00 PM
in BC 163 and starts week 2. Check the Math Resource Center website or
drop by the center for more information.</p>
</div>
<div id="help-hours-guidelines" class="section level3">
<h3>Help Hours Guidelines</h3>
<p>It is strongly recommended that you attend the walk-in help hours or
set up a one-to-one meeting with the me if you feel like you are falling
behind during our in-person class activities, or if you just need to
clarify concepts discussed in class. In order to be more productive
during a one-to-one meeting (or the walk-in help hours), these are three
recommendations before you come in:</p>
<ul>
<li>List all gaps in knowledge you have (missed concepts) or list all
concepts that were unclear to you during class. We will address them one
by one.</li>
<li>Prepare questions you want answered and be ready to show relevant
materials.</li>
<li>Regarding assignments, prepare to show (a) what are the steps you
have tried and (b) what are the errors you encountered and the
strategies you have tried.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these are recommendations so that you can get the most out
of the help hours allocated for you. If you just want to come in and
chat about something else, feel free to do so. If the dedicated time for
one-to-one meeting does not work for you, send me a message to set up an
appointment.</p>
</div>
<div id="collaboration-policy" class="section level3">
<h3>Collaboration Policy</h3>
<p>I expect you to participate in the class through lectures,
discussion, labs, and other engagements. I also expect you to make use
of opportunities to get help outside of class (help hours, Teams, email,
tutoring) if you need help. Concise and specific messages are the most
helpful so I know how I can best help you.</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to participate in discussions with their
peers (or each other) regarding homework and other assignments. However,
each student must take responsibility and ownership of their work and
submit their work individually.</p>

<h2><strong>Assessment</strong></h2>
<div id="assessment-disclosure-statement" class="section level3">
<h3>Assessment Disclosure Statement</h3>
<p>Student work products for this course may be used by the University
for educational quality assurance purposes. For reasons of

</div>
<div id="standards-based-grading" class="section level3">
<h3>Standards-Based Grading</h3>
<p>Learning mathematics takes hard work, thinking what you have learned,
and making changes to your understanding. Students will be assessed on
their proficiency in mathematics, and they will have opportunities to
demonstrate their proficiency, revise their work and reflect on their
learning.</p>
<p>This course follows the standards-based grading system which focuses
on the mastery of specific learning standards. It is more accurate and
motivating than traditional grading systems, and can help to create a
more equitable learning environment. Here are some of the key features
of this type of grading:</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>
<p>Each assignment will be graded according to the general grading guide
detailed below. Each student will be given feedback on their assignment
and learning process to improve their performance. Note that each
assignment has its own rubric guided by these general guidelines and the
assignmentâs learning objectives.</p>
<p>Given the following categorical grade, the studentâs work is able
to:</p>

Suggestions: âAdobe Scanâ for Android or iOS.</p>
</div>
<div id="worksheets" class="section level3">
<h3>Worksheets</h3>
<p>There will be worksheets for each non-exam week. The purpose of the
worksheets is for in-class group work and activities. The group members
must submit their completed worksheet individually by end-of-class or
end-of-day. Worksheets are graded mostly on completion, and partially on
correctness. Your name must exist in your worksheet and the names of
your collaborators.</p>

understanding of the material verbally. It is administered mostly in
dialog style during exam days. The oral exam lasts only ten to fifteen
minutes and includes predetermined questions about problems from the
written exam, which are provided to the student ahead of time. This part
will be evaluated on your ability to explain key concepts and navigate
through different ways to solve problems, rather than detailed
solutions.</p>
<p><em>Amendment 5:</em> The sentence âThe oral exam is only ten to
fifteen minutes and it consists of one or two problems similar to the

<h3>Late Assignments</h3>
<p>You are expected to turn in all completed assignments on time.
Circumstances that may disallow you to turn in your work on time - such
as a medical reason - are understandable. Please let me know if you are
unable to submit your work and have missed the deadline way beyond its
original posted date. Because every assignment is an important aspect of
your learning in this class, we will discuss when you will turn in the
assignment as well as decide upon an acceptable consequence for your
turning it in late. I am committed to successfully helping you learn
from this course.</p>
</div>
<div id="incompletes" class="section level3">
<h3>Incompletes</h3>
<p>An incomplete <em>I</em> will only be considered when the quality of
a studentâs work is satisfactory (C- or better), but for some essential
reason the course has not been completed by the student. An (I) is
reserved for emergency situations only. To request an incomplete, the
student must submit a typed, signed and dated letter stating the
reason(s) why an incomplete is appropriate. The letter should also
contain the conditions for the completion of work. Acceptance of the
request shall be at the discretion of the instructor, Department Chair,
and/or Dean of the College of Arts &amp; Sciences.</p>
</div>
<div id="accessibility-statement" class="section level3">
<h3>Accessibility Statement</h3>
<p>The University of Portland strives to make its courses and services
fully accessible to all students. Students are encouraged to discuss
with their instructors what might be most helpful in enabling them to
meet the learning goals of the course. Students who experience a
disability are also encouraged to use the services of the Office for
Accessible Education Services (AES), located in the Shepard Academic
Resource Center (503-943-8985). <strong>If you have an AES Accommodation
Plan</strong>, you should meet with your instructor to discuss how to
implement your plan in this class. Requests for alternate location for
exams and/or extended exam time should, where possible, be made two
weeks in advance of an exam, and must be made at least one week in
advance of an exam. Also, if applicable, you should meet with your
instructor to discuss emergency medical information or how best to
ensure your safe evacuation from the building in case of fire or other
emergency. All information that students provide regarding disability or
accommodation is confidential. All students are responsible for
completing the required coursework and are held to the same evaluation
standards specified in the course syllabus.</p>
</div>
<div id="code-of-academic-integrity" class="section level3">
<h3>Code of Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>The University of Portland is a diverse academic community of
learners and scholars who are dedicated to freely sharing ideas and
engaging in respectful discussion of those ideas to discover truth. Such
pursuits require each person, whether student or faculty, to present
truthfully our own ideas and give credit to others for the ideas that
they generate. Thus, cheating on exams, copying another studentâs
assignment, including homework, or using the work of others without
proper citation are some examples of violating academic integrity.</p>
<p>Especially for written and oral assignments, students have an ethical
responsibility to properly cite the authors of any books, articles, or
other sources that they use. Students should expect to submit
assignments to Turnitin, a database that ensures assignments are
original work of the student submitting. Each discipline has guidelines
for how to give appropriate credit, and instructors will communicate the
specific guidelines for their discipline. The Clark Library also
maintains a webpage that provides citation guidelines at <a
href="libguides.up.edu/cite"
target="_blank">https://libguides.up.edu/cite</a>.</p>
<p>The misuse of AI to shortcut course learning outcomes will be treated
as a violation of academic integrity comparable to plagiarism or
cheating. Faculty are responsible for including a written âCourse AI
Policyâ in their syllabi that clearly states what they consider
appropriate and inappropriate uses of AI in the context of their
courses. Students are responsible for using AI in ways that do not
detract from the established learning outcomes of the course. All
members of the scholarly community are responsible for demonstrating
sound judgment in discerning when and how to utilize AI in their work,
upholding standards of citation, originality, and integrity.</p>
<p>Please see the University Bulletin for further information: <a

<div id="course-ai-policy" class="section level3">
<h3>Course AI Policy</h3>
<p>The use of generative AI â such as Copilot, Gemini, or ChatGPT â is
encouraged and allowed in all of its capacity. However, students must
use these tools ethically and responsibly. To use generative AI
responsibly in this class, students should grasp underlying concepts,
acknowledge AIâs assistance, protect data privacy, verify information,
and uphold academic honor code. AI should be seen as a learning aid, not
a replacement for critical thinking.</p>
</div>
<div id="referencing-and-citation-guidelines" class="section level3">
<h3>Referencing and Citation Guidelines</h3>
<p>In your written work for this course, you must cite all sources of
information that you use, whether they are direct quotes, paraphrases,
or summaries. The style of citation that you use should be consistent
throughout your paper. The citation styles for this course are APA or
CSE.</p>
<ul>
<li>APA style is used in the social sciences and psychology. It is
characterized by parenthetical citations that include the authorâs last
name and the year of publication. For example, âAccording to Smith
(2023), the average height of a man in the United States is 5â10â.â</li>
<li>CSE style is used in the natural sciences and engineering. It is
characterized by numbered citations that are listed at the end of the
paper. For example, â[1] Smith, J. (2023). The average height of a man
in the United States. Journal of Human Biology, 55(2), 123-132.â</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are unsure which citation style to use, please consult with
me. You can also find more information about APA and CSE style in the
Clark Library citation guidelines: <a
href="https://libguides.up.edu/cite"
target="_blank">libguides.up.edu/cite</a></p>
<p>Plagiarism is the act of using someone elseâs work without giving
them credit. It is a serious academic offense that can result in a
failing grade or even expulsion from school. By following these
guidelines, you can help to avoid plagiarism and ensure that your work
is properly cited.</p>

<h3>Non-Violence Statement</h3>
<p>The University of Portland is committed to fostering a safe and
respectful community free from all forms of violence. Violence of any
kind, and in particular acts of power-based personal violence, are
inconsistent with our mission. Together, all UP community members must
take a stand against violence. Learn more about what interpersonal
violence looks like, campus and community resources, UPâs prevention
strategy, and what we as individuals can do to assist on the <a

<h3>Ethics of Information</h3>
<p>The University of Portland is a community dedicated to the
investigation and discovery of processes for thinking ethically and
encouraging the development of ethical reasoning in the formation of the
whole person. Using information ethically, as an element in open and
honest scholarly endeavors, involves moral reasoning to determine the
right way to access, create, distribute, and employ information,
including: considerations of intellectual property rights, fair use,
information bias, censorship, and privacy. More information can be found
in the Clark Libraryâs guide to the Ethical Use of Information at <a

of Information</a> at <a href="https://libguides.up.edu/ethicaluse"

<div id="diversity-and-inclusion-statement" class="section level3">
<h3>Diversity and Inclusion Statement</h3>
<p>In the study of natural and mathematical sciences, often perceived as
objective disciplines aimed at understanding the world, it is crucial to
recognize the historical biases embedded within these fields, stemming
from a limited set of privileged populations. Acknowledging the
potential existence of overt and covert biases within the course, I
emphasize that science is a human endeavor necessitating the
incorporation of diverse experiences in the pursuit of knowledge and
skill. Valuing every student irrespective of background, origin, race,
religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability status, etc., I am
committed to fostering an inclusive climate throughout the course.
Encouraging open communication about concerns or challenges, I assure
confidentiality, except for instances of academic integrity violations
or sexual harassment, which are legally mandated to be reported. Within
our classroom, diversity and individual differences are celebrated as
strengths, and the use of mathematics as an analytical tool to challenge
power, privilege, and oppression is supported. It is our collective
responsibility to create a welcoming space where ideas can be challenged
while maintaining respect for individuals.</p>
